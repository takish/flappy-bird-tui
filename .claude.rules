Never use console.log or fmt.Println in game logic - use storage.PlaySound() for audio feedback
Always run go fmt before committing
Maintain Model immutability - return new game.Model from Update(), never mutate in place
Keep ui.View() pure - no side effects, only render based on game.Model
Add tests for new physics or scoring logic in domain/ and storage/ packages
Use lipgloss for all terminal styling in ui/ - no ANSI codes directly
Keep game speed between 10-60ms for playability
Preserve GameState transitions through resetGame() - never lose high scores
Use constants for magic numbers (pipe gaps, speeds, dimensions) in domain/ package
Always handle terminal resize gracefully in Bubble Tea updates
Follow layered architecture - domain/ has no external dependencies, game/ uses domain/, ui/ renders game.Model
