Never use console.log or fmt.Println in game logic - use PlaySound() for audio feedback
Always run go fmt before committing
Maintain Model immutability - return new Model from Update(), never mutate in place
Keep View() pure - no side effects, only render based on Model
Add tests for new physics or scoring logic
Use lipgloss for all terminal styling - no ANSI codes directly
Keep game speed between 10-60ms for playability
Preserve GameState transitions through resetGame() - never lose high scores
Use constants for magic numbers (pipe gaps, speeds, dimensions)
Always handle terminal resize gracefully in Bubble Tea updates
